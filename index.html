  <p> A visualization of ufo sightings in the U.S. with durations between 5 seconds and 5 hours, plotted by latitude and longitude and colored/sized by the
  log of the duration in seconds. A lighter color corresponds to a longer duration, and a darker color corresponds to a shorter one.</p>
  
  <p> The dataset was the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings?select=complete.csv">Kaggle UFO Signtings dataset</a>. I removed the datapoints
  corresponding to a duration of less than 5 seconds as well as those corresponding to a duration of more than 5 hours, choosing to focus on UFO sightings between those
  time frames.</p>
